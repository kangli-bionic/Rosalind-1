def iev(genotypes):
    ''' Calculating Expected Offspring

    Given: Six positive integers, each of which does not
    exceed 20,000. The integers correspond to the number of
    couples in a population possessing each genotype pairing
    for a given factor. In order, the six given integers
    represent the number of couples having the following genotypes:

    AA-AA, AA-Aa, AA-aa, Aa-Aa, Aa-aa, aa-aa

    Return: The expected number of offspring displaying the dominant
    phenotype in the next generation, under the assumption that every
    couple has exactly two offspring.
